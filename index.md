# Jenkins for Serverless Functions
-----

Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers.
Using AWS and its Serverless Platform, you can build and deploy applications on cost-effective services 
that provide built-in application availability and flexible scaling capabilities.

### Background
-----

Today large U.S. Government Agency require a development pipeline for serverless cloud solutions. As most 
changes are put through no standard of tests, code changes have no visibility nor accountability scheme set 
before promotion to production environments. They will need a multi-branch pipeline that conducts code 
analysis. This pipeline will need a system set up that allows for easy tracking of created deployments and 
archives. It is imperative that the organization be able to deploy these code changes automatically to 
desired test or production environment at the completion of a successful job
